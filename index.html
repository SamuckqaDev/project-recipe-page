          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and
            chocolate powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and
            baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake liners lined
            with paper pans and place in a large cake pan, one next to the
            other. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until baked
            and golden. Remove and let cool. <br />
            <br />
            For the filling, bring all the ingredients to medium heat, stirring
            well until thickened. Turn off, let cool and place inside a piping
            bag with a perle nozzle. Book. Place the whipped cream inside a
            piping bag with a pitanga nozzle and set aside. <br />
            <br />
            For assembly, make a hole in the center of the cupcakes and fill
            with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the surfaces of the
            cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Garnish
            with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
